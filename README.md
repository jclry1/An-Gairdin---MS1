# An Gáirdín
![Testing An Gairdin](assets/images/readme-images/angairdin-multidevice.png)

OK. An Gáirdín is an ecology and education center located in Portumna, Co Galway, Ireland.

The organisation runs a small organic market garden and orchard and also has a dedicated educational space for running courses and workshops. These range from spirituality to organic gardening to plastic pollution and climate change.

### Site Purpose 
An Gairdin has an [existing Wordpress](https://www.angairdin.ie) site but it is infrequently updated and the lack of design (the site is a simple Wordpress template) means it comes across as distant, clinical, and superficial. The aim of this redesign is to create a more welcoming online space for people interested in the project to get a sense of what it is about, the values it strives to uphold, and the activities that go on there. The target audience includes a demographic that may not necessarily be very tech-savvy. With this in mind, the site should present simple, consistent navigation and contact options. Links to any external sites should be clearly accessible on all pages.

## UX
The site design aims to provide a simple and inviting space, encouraging further interaction with the project either online or in person.
A brief history of the project should be included as well as information on the main activities.
A contact option should be available and this should be straighforward and non-intimidating.

### Target audience
The primary audience for the website is local to the area (within 100 km) and encompasses regular visitors who may wish to get in contact or see updates, and new visitors who may become supporters. 

### User Stories
* As a visitor familiar with the project, I want to be able to easily get in touch with a comment or question.
* As a new visitor unfamiliar with the project I want to see a visually appealing introduction to the aims and activites undertaken and be able to easily join a mailing list or otherwise get in touch.
* As a local food enthusiast, I want to see information about the garden produce and see where this is sold locally.
* As a like-minded educator, I want to see some background information on the project and then easily get in touch with collaboration ideas using a contact form.
* As an older user or a user less-accustomed to online interation, I want to see an inviting and easy to navigate space that makes me feel at ease and is in line with my experience of the physical space.

* As a site-owner, I want to have an interenet presence that employs a look and feel in line with our aims, practices and goals. The site should mirror the atmosphere we endeavour to achieve in the physical location. 
* As a site-owner, I want site visitors to easily be able to get in touch with a question or comment, or to ask to be added to the mailing list.
* As a site-owner, I want any contact initiated on the website to go directly to my mail inbox. (nice to have, not a requirement for MS-1).
* As a site-owner, I want a visitor to be able to quickly jump to our social-media presence (facebook) where we have more up-to-date info.

### Wireframe Mockups
[Wireframe mockups](assets/docs/wireframe_v1.pdf) were developed before any coding took place and aim to give an outline of the final layout and flow of the site.

The initial version of the wireframe was largely adhered to but there were some changes as the design was built, including:
* Plan to have navigation buttons on the home page was discarded as they looked cluttered and detracted from the look of the page. The hamburger icon is used on smaller screens and the navigation menu opens across the fixed top and larger scren sizes. Instead of navigation buttons, the landing page shows the entrance to the physical space and includes a message clearly identifying the underlying ethos of the organisation.
* Plan for an image carousel was replaced with the use of Bootstrap card decks with image caps. These provide context to the card text and provide sufficient graphic interest on each of the pages.  A repsonsive gallery page is also included, but with any text context provided.

### Color Palette
The color palette used in the site aims to mirror the changing colours of the seasons in a garden and to be at the same time warm, vibrant and inviting. Ideas in relation to colour have been gleaned from general reading. 
Two useful resources have been [elementor](https://elementor.com/blog/color-theory-web-design/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KKeRi1NNrRWesVXyhOmyfNpwLFH8CCWWnFQ6Ael53UB6eYECiUufkAaAmKeEALw_wcB) and [coolors] (https://coolors.co/f94144-f3722c-f8961e-f9c74f-90be6d-43aa8b-577590).
Color selection on the site is guided by the palette described in the [draft color scheme](assets/color/draft-color-scheme.pdf).

There are two main colours used across the site:
#f9c74f:
* header
* top border on blockquotes
* border of input fields on the contact form
* border and text (pending contrasat check) of the welcome circle on home page
* social links - hover

#438397 and variant rgba(67, 131, 151, 0.9)
* footer
* background of the welcome message on home page
* background of the form area

Additional colours complementing the above are:
* #fef8e9 - background colour on all pages (except index.html)
* #215445 - heading (h2, h5) on about and garden pages
* #fafafa - text in footer and contact form, social icons (no hover) in footer
* #193f34 - text (logo and nav items) in header
* #873408 - text: hover (logo and nav items) in the header

For information on some color changes due to accessibility testing see [Testing](testing.md).

## Features

### Navigation bar 
The site has a navigation bar integrated into the header. This is consistent across the top of all pages (fixed/no-scroll) of the site and therefore easily learnable for users. It is also a very familiar pattern internet-wide and should present little or no difficulties for users. 
On small screen sizes the navigation is collapsed and can be expanded by clicking the hamburger icon. On larger screens, the navigation is expanded by default. 
The text logo on the right side of the header is also present on all pages and serves as a link back to the home page.
All links in the header are styled consistent with the site color scheme and have styling on hover.

### Logo
The project logo (text) is presented in the header on all pages.

### Footer 
Each page has a standard footer with copyright info (left) and social media links (right). In reality, this project has a presence on facebook only. For the purposes of the MS1 project, dummy links to social media sites are included (facebook, twitter, vimeo).
Copyright information is consistently displayed in the page footer (left).

Social media links are styled on hover and change color consistently with the site pallette.

### Home Page

The home page (index.html) features a real sense of the physical space occupied by this project. The colors of the image and the site header echo each other, as do the site footer and the background of the welcome/mission text. The home page clearly sets the tone for the whole site - inviting to visitors and clear in its values.
The background image (of an entranceway) also echoes the purpose of the home page.

### About
The About page uses a Bootstrap card deck to present the history of the project.
The text content is broken into three sections to improve the visual appearance and add other points of interest - each text block is enhanced with a top image and a quote that reinforces the purpose and the influences that drive the project. For the purposes of semantic HTML, the quotes are 'blockquote' and all inclue a cite attribute. The quotes are set off from the text with a top border echoing the site's header colour. The quotes replace the standard Bootstrap 'card-footer' element.
Text and quotes have been allocated to cards to achieve a well-balanced and consistent (aligned) layout. 

### Garden
The Garden page has two sections: Produce and Process
The layout of each mirrors the layout of the about page and again each text block is enhanced with an appropriate image and blockquote. All images (all pages) have the alt attribute filled.

### Responsive Gallery
The site contains a gallery page showing additional images form the physical location and adding to the sense of purpose outlined on the about.html and garden.html pages. 
The gallery layout adjust to the scrren size of the visitor, shifting from one to two to four columns,

### Contact
The Contact page features a contact form that allows for a simple message and the option to subscribe to the project's mailing list. The text area limits input to 400 characters.
(Note: To make the form actually work is outside the scope of this MS1 project).
Styling of the contact form is consistent with the other pages of the site. For example, the hover color of input area borders align with the site header. The background aligns with the background of the welcome message onthe home page.

The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button**
The send button text is customised to maintain the welcoming feel of the project and the colour (incl hover) is also customised to align with the overall look and feel of the site. A tooltip alerts any visitor to the test/educational site that the form does not currently work.
 
### Features to Implement in Future
Based on the exisitng design, here are what I feel are the most warranted additions in the short term:
* Make the contact form function
* Add information using another medium than text and image - ie embedded video.
* Include a section that updates on a regular basis without input from the site owners - for example a twiiter feed. This could inlcude content from other sites with a similar purpose, or to provide information on aspects of the site that visitors may be interested in  - for example organic food news, climate change updates etc.

## Technologies Used

#### HTML
The site is built using HTML and uses semantic markup - for example blockquote with cite attribute and small element for copyright info.

#### CSS
Styling is achieved using CSS and aims to achieve a consistent look and fel across all pages. Media queries are used to maintain the desired performance at all screen resolutions - for example to shrink social media icons at very small screen sizes.

#### Bootstrap 4
The Bootsrap 4 framework is used to achieve the layout of content on the about.html and garden.html pages. Custom CSS is added to achieve correct padding and alignment for text and blockquote elements within the cards.
Bootstrap is also used as the basis for the navigation.
JQuery and Popper are utilised for some aspects of Boostrap functionality - ie collapsing navigation.

#### Gitpod
The Gitpod IDE is used for all development.

#### GitHub
The content is stored in GitHub and served on GitHub Pages.

#### Git 
Version control is achieved using Git. 

#### Prettier
Prettier has been used for code formatting.

#### Emmet
Emmet has been used for quicker coding in Gitpod.

#### Google DevTools
The DevTools in Google Chrome have been invaluable in isolating layout issues and finding workable solutions quickly.

## Additional Resources
#### Tiny JPG
[TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) is used to compress all images before being uploaded to the GitHub repository.

#### Coolors
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is used to generate a consistent and aligned color scheme.
 
#### Autoprefixer
[Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) is used to add vendor prefixes in the CSS file.

#### Responsinator
[Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) is used to check the appearance of the published site on different devices.

## Testing - Process, Issues, Resolutions
See [Testing](testing.md).

## Main Issues Overcome
There have been lots of msall issues that were reolved quickly by checking the Bootstrap documentation or a quick Google search. More persistent problems which took some time to remedy were:

#### Bootstrap Card Footers
Problems getting the footers in the boostrap cards (card-deck) to align. Tried several options from stackoverflow and elsewhere but none seemed to work. Best solution I've found so far was this: In the card-body div (Bootstrap) add a new div below the title to contain the paragraph content. Call this .card-content. Set the parent card-body to be: .card-body{ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: flex-start; } On the new child div, apply: .card-content{ align-self: stretch; height: 100%; }

It seems to need both the stretch and 100% to work.
That pushes the footer to the end of th card. However, if the footers have differeing amount of content, they now push up to different heights at the bottom of the card. Resolved this with a fixed-height footer to allow space for 3 lines of small text.

Info for this solution derived from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container

Note - I changed the use of the default bootstrap card footers to blockquotes and maintained the applicable part so the solution above. For the purposes of an aligned display, it has also been necessary to keep text lengths inthe cards and footers to a similar length.

#### Container-Fluid Margins
I experienced an issue with container-fluid introducing unwanted margin on right side at small screen sizes. Finally resolved with: .container-fluid{ overflow-x: hidden; } Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25427407/bootstrap-3-and-4-container-fluid-with-grid-adding-unwanted-padding

#### Vertical Stretch
I had an issue with getting the main content area to stretch vertically to fill the available space. Fixed with adding vh-100 to all parents: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30469177/make-bootstrap-column-touch-the-bottom-of-the-div/30480004#30480004

#### Header Overlaying Content
After researching this issue, it was fixed with this solution (adding padding to the body): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10336194/top-nav-bar-blocking-top-content-of-the-page

## Deployment
The site is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). During development, I viewed and tested the output of the code by running the the site on my local machine through Gitpod.
This local hosting served very well for quick checks as to the effect of code hanges. As the site neared completion and was ready for online testing, I deployed to GitHub Pages as follows:
1. On GitHub, in the project repository, choose *Settings*.
2. Verify the repo name and go to the *GitHub Pages* section.
3. Enter the details where required, in this case:
* Branch is master and the directory is the default top level (root).
* Theme: None, custom domain: none
* HTTPS is enforced by default. 
4. After a couple of minutes the site is available online.
5. During testing any problems found are fixed in Gitpod. The changes are committed and then pushed to GitHub. After pushing, the live site is automatically updated.

To run a copy of the site locally, [download a zip file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2751227/how-to-download-source-in-zip-format-from-github#:~:text=To%20simply%20download%20a%20repository,file%20of%20the%20whole%20lot.&text=It%20then%20gives%20you%20a%20zip%20file%20to%20download.) of the repository contents or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository and run that in your IDE or local machine.

Once deployed, all testing was done on the live site at: https://workingedge.github.io/An-Gairdin---MS1/
